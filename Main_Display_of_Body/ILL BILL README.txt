ILL BILL README
To play ILL BILL simply take the IllBill.exe/IllBill.apk (whichever is your preferred platform) and begin the process:
-	ANDROID: Surefire way, open up Unity 5 and select “Build and Run” in the options menu.  This will build the application and place it into any connected android device.
-	ALTERNATIVE: To “Sideload” IllBill.apk for Android. Place the apk file in the android device’s file manager and then open the file and hit “install.” You may need to configure your device’s security settings for this to work.  **This is not recommended**
-	PC: Double click the .exe file named “IllBill.exe” in the main directory.
Note: Never compile with a GameData.txt file in the main directory, this can mess up the compilation process and this file should be deleted or moved out of the directory until after the compilation.
